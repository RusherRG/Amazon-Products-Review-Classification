## About

- The Amazon product details and reviews page for OnePlus 6T was scraped using selenium and beutifulsoup. 
- All the reviews scraped were classified into 5 categories namely Battery Life, Value for Money, Fingerprint, Picture and Sound Quality.  
- Sentiment Analysis of the reviews was performed further classifying them as positive, negative and neutral.
- A dashboard was also made to visualize the output of the analysis.
