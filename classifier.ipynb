The low light photography could still be improved.\\nBattery - With average usage with full day data on, it easily lasts upto 2 days. The Warp charging is just amazing, it takes around 40-45 mins to charge from 0-100%. But you could easily get a day's charge within 20 mins.\\nSpeed - With 10 Gigs of RAM, speed should not be a question. You could open up 5 high specs games and it still wouldn't lag.

       "   'review': \"I pre-ordered the phone on 9th Oct and literally waited for more than a month for this phone. It was worth waiting.\\nPhone looks similar to one plus 6 however the technology you get in this phone is updated and is latest. The notch looks beautiful compared to other waterdrop notch phones. I'm not an audiphile so can't complain much about the removal of headphone jack. I'm pretty comfortable with wireless earphones. The OS is something which needs to be considered the most on a phone, which most of the people ignore. I migrated from a Sony phone and see a huge difference in the usage, the OS is smooth as butter and is calibrated for daily driver. You can perform many tasks at a snap of your fingers and never experience a lag on the phone. Camera is good, clicks are clear. Portrait and night mode are very useful and handy. Slow motion works well. Battery life is comparably good, you get around 6 hrs of SOT from a full charge. I feel that's more than enough for a daily driver and works well for gamers. Charging is pretty fast you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20min.\\n\\nI feel it's worth paying 40k for a premium phone like this, which offers good support for your OS and provides Android updates for 2 yrs. Rather than spending 25k+ for plastic and non premium phones. BTW this comes with no bloatware and is completely based on stock OS which contains a lot of tweaks and customizatios. That's the best part of the phone.\\nGo for it if you don't want to compromise !!\",\n",

You may miss the notification led and the 3.5 mm audio jack. The in screen fingerprint reader is a cool feature but surely feels that first gen not so smooth feature. It just gives you the feeling of not buying a finished product but a work in progress kind of a thing. Not many things to complaint about since it does give you good specifications for a decent price but.. it's no longer a flagship killer to stay. One plus may very well be the new apple. I'd hate to see that happen, but they're in the business for profit afterall. It can't always all be about the community. But I see them get run over by budget phones if their competition could maintain quality\",\n",

       "   'review': \"The most COMPLETE and HONEST review :-\\nThis phone is OUTSTANDING! Mostly in a really good sense, ALTHOUGH somewhere we HAVE TO SETTLE.\\nCONS (Ranked) -\\n1. NO STEREO SPEAKERS , although single mono speaker is good.\\n2. HEADPHONE AUDIO OUTPUT (c type / 3.5 mm / whatever) is ABOVE AVERAGE, but should have been better with greater bass and more fuller ambient sound like LG G7 ThinQ etc. I'll update my review about the Cirrus Logic DAC and Oneplus C type Bullets later.\\n3. Camera depends upon good lighting conditions. TOO MUCH CROP IN FRONT CAMERA VIDEO DUE TO EIS. BLUR IN NIGHTSCAPE, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S MOVEMENT IN FRAME. Wide angle camera should have been a must.\\n4. Fingerprint scanner is like 90% hit and 10% miss. For 97% hit and 3% miss, INPUT SAME FINGER TWICE OR THRICE. PROPER PLACEMENT OF FINGER ON SCANNER is IMPORTANT. However it's SUFFICIENTLY FAST. Placement should have been upper on the screen.\\n5. NO NOTIFICATION LED. SCREEN OFF GESTURES (like O for camera) are HITS AND MISSES OCCASIONALLY.\\nP. S. NO HEADPHONE JACK, NO QHD RESOLUTION and NO WIRELESS CHARGING are NOT CONS, atleast for me.\\nPROS (Ranked) -\\n1. The very BEST SOFTWARE, UI, PERFORMANCE. (CLEAN, FAST AND SMOOTH). MANY CUSTOMISATIONS. BETTER THAN STOCK ANDROID.\\n2. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY and DESIGN like in display fingerprint scanner, cute waterdrop notch etc.\\n3. PREMIUM AND DURABLE BUILD QUALITY. UNOFFICIALLY WATERPROOF.\\n4. GREAT BATTERY life AND DASH CHARGING.\\n5. Great screen.\\n6. Camera can compete with PIXEL 3.\\n7. GREAT VALUE for the price. However, COULD BE of GREATER VALUE. COMPETITION - LG G7 ThinQ, Asus Zenfone 5Z, iPhone 6S plus, etc.\\nP. S. You'll read many PROS in official reviews in the internet, YouTube etc..\\nAll in all, the phone and the brand DESERVES YOUR ATTENTION.\\n4.5 OUT OF 5 - ABHISHEK CHAKRAVORTY\",\n",

       "   'review': 'DESIGN:\\nIf you thinking that OnePlus 6 and 6T has no major difference than you are absolutely wrong and highly mistaken if you thing 6 is better than 6T. Price hike is completely justified.\\n\\nVisible differences between 6 & 6T:\\nHigher screen to body ratio, Gorilla Glass 6, in-display fingerprint scanner, taller, water-drop notch. 3700mAh battery.\\n\\nTechnical advancement:\\nAdvance AI which smartly uses your RAM and ROM which actually boosts the performance, Better heat-sink than 6.\\n\\nCAMERA:\\nI took my canon 1300D with two lens; portrait and 18-55 and OnePlus6T for comparison test. OnePlus 6T provided better results when both on Auto-mode. It has amazing contrast, perfect saturation; but the thing where it stood-out from others its it night picture quality. It does wonders even if there is almost no light and that is some magic over there. Front camera absolutely stunning and comes with screen flash for low light selfies.\\nBATTERY:\\nBattery charging- 0 to 65% in 30 mins and at 45 min it reaches 86%. Full charge by 1hr8 mins when internet, Bluetooth and wifi off. On heavy use it survives 8 hrs (I watched 2 movies in HD with 50% screen brightness and 1 hour PubG gaming on HD, 1 hour YouTubing). On average usage, 17 hours very smoothly(casual social media surfing, browsing, camera usage about 5 to 6 pictures using flash). Without internet usage at all and battery saver on, it can go whooping 3 DAYS !\\n\\nSPEAKERS:\\nExternal speakers are loud, I mean really very loud. Hearing speaker is very cool by its looks and loud too. Volume rockers and power switch is perfectly hard.\\n\\nSECURITY:\\nThough I feel face detection is worst type of security because it has many drawbacks, its quick. And finger print scanner is also faster than its competitors. The part which irritates is that while using at night in dark, for face and fingerprint detection, the display gets 100% to scan which is very annoying and very uneasy for eyes.',\n",

       "   'review': \"I am a big fan of Apple. Have been using Iphone from last 5 years. Wanted to change the phone to the new one. But not much of Innovation from Apple. So, I switched to Oneplus and Oneplus 6T was a best replacement.\\nThe OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.\\nDesign: Just gorgeous - the curve of the camera bump is more of a design accent than a notch. The phone has a huge 6.41 in screen, but is still easily managed with one hand. The color is amazing - Mirror Black. The 6T feels like it was meant to fit in my hand. The first party OnePlus cases accent the amazing design and make it even more comfortable. When you hold the phone, you will know exactly what I mean!\\n\\nBattery: Lasts more than a day with heavy use. I can get almost 6 hrs of screen on time even after watching YouTube, gaming, and general usage. Even better, the included dash charger fills the battery extremely quickly. No wireless charging, but I don't even miss it.\\n\\nCamera: Solid - 4K 60FPS video looks great. Other phones in this price range can't even touch the quality of the camera for pictures. Night shot is solid, looking forward to Future tweeks to prevent the blown out appearance when some light is present.\\n\\nSound: Probably the only change I would make. The since downward firing speaker is easy to block. The quality is great - would love to see the dual speaker in the next OnePlus phone.\\n\\nWhile you could say that OnePlus has made some sacrifices in developing the OnePlus 6T, they all seem rather subjective. Sure it’s a slightly bigger, thicker, heavier phone than the 6 but if that means a bigger battery with better longevity is it really a loss?\\nThe headphone jack’s absence is annoying for some but the phone comes with an adapter and the in-display fingerprint sensor might not have fit in the same footprint otherwise.\",\n",

But there are some issues which i am mentioning below.\\n1- battery is not so good, its draning fast not so fast but ya fast.\\n2- there is no am -pm in clock which very basic function in every damn phone.\\n3- you can face internet problem may be your sim doesn't support the handset. But there is issue.\\n4- performance what i was expecting is not top notch what company claiming. You can get same kind of speed in 20k phone easily.\\n5- lastly the finger scanning lock is not so fast, sometimes it takes 2-3 attempts.\\nGuys this is my geniune report about this phone. I m very much fan of oneplus family. But 2 times i took wrong decisions 1- for oneplus 5 it was a worst phone and\\n2- OnePlus 6t actually its not a worst phone but i was expecting a top notch speed. But OnePlus 6t not match that level.\\nIf you have budget to buy and you want it anyhow than you can go for it.... Otherwise there are lots of better options. Available in market in 20k which match almost same quality & look. So don't waste your money if you don't have much in your pocket. Don't push your self to buy this phone.\\nI am give this phone 3 star just bcz its not that bad but its not that good. Now choices upto you.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Overall: 8/10:\\nA fantastic package at good value. 6T McLaren is'nt much different from the standard 6T except for the RAM and some minor cosmetic changes. But for a long time fan of the Silver Arrows from Mika Hakkinen's time, a small increase in price was worth it. Call me sentimental! :)\\n\\nUnboxing & contents: 8/10\\nOne of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.\\n\\nFirst Impressions: 9/10\\nThe device is actually pretty impressive looking. Especially the orange accents at the Bezel on the back. When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.\\n\\nSetup: 8/10\\nThe SIM Card tray is a standard two Nano-SIM one. No SD Card support still! But with 240 GB usable memory, not much of an issue to be honest. I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.\\n\\nBattery: 7/10\\nThe unit came with 50% power out of the box and it took me a good 30 minutes to get it to 75% despite using the Warp Charge @ 30W. Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.\\n\\nPerformance: 9/10\\nGaming: Initial performance on gaming is very very good (Asphalt 9 Legends and Real Racing 3). Zero lag and super smooth rendering. Bloons TD6 is a very resource hungry at lategame levels and the 6T McLaren made short work of it.\\n\\nDisplay: The display is really mind-blowing. Video on Youtube and other streaming apps was super smooth and brilliant to look at. One cool feature is that you can pinch zoom the content to include / exclude the waterdrop notch for front camera. Adaptive brightness is annoying at times and I had to turn it off while playing the racing games.\\n\\nCamera: Have not tested the Camera performance yet. Especially the 4K 60 FPS option. Will do it soon and update the review.\\n\\nHope this helps!\",\n",

It means you will have lesser call drops in low connection areas.\\n4. Amoled screen gives a comfortable reading.\\n5. BATTERY : usual business day - 18 hours\\nGaming - on 100% charge run PubG 7 full length games for like 5 hours of continuous gaming. No Lags! Extreme graphics and no heating.\\nCharges full 100% in 30 -40 mins. Very fast!\\n6. Amazing camera experience! It's not as best as Google Pixel but then it can be optimised for great shots. 4K videos at 60fps you can take! It's gorgeous.\\n7. 128GB storage!\\n\\nWhat I didn't like about OnePlus 6T:\\n1. No notification LED due to drop notch.\\n2. Unsure if this is waterproof.\\n3. Volume buttons should have been placed better.\\n4. Pretty heavy phone.\\n5. Reading mode SUCKS! It totally gets like Kindle, all black and white but you can customise it for certain apps.\\nHope this is a simple review to make your choice.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'I have been using this device for over a week now and so far it has turned out to be a beast of a device. Here are my observations:\\n1. The in-display screen unlocker: It is flawed. Takes a bit of a time to unlock and you have to place the finger properly. But this was not that big of a deal, since the face unlocking is supremely fast. Its a novelty kind of thing. looks nice when it works. 4/5 for this\\n2. Camera: my previous device was OP 5t. The picture quality has increased manifold. Nightscape, studio lighting and ultra slo-mo video works like a charm. 5/5 for this\\n3. Battery life: the first day, the device got slightly heated when i used oneplus switch so the battery drained quickly. But over the week, it has given me wonderful battery backup. No heating issue. With average to heavier usage, it still gave me 1.5 days backup. The charging is very fast. 40 minutes to charge from 10 to 95%. More than sufficient. 4.75/5 for this\\n4. Speaker: Only one speaker is present, but it gives out very loud output. Gives very good clarity and loud ringing. No complaints or issues regarding this. 5/5\\n5. OS: It is the cleanest and simplest OS yet. Lots and lots of customization, minimum bloatware. clean interface. in OP5T, the messaging app did not differentiate between marketing related messages and actual messages. fortunately, this phone has that capability. Loved the gestures as well. Optimizations are also great new feature. 5/5\\n6. Build: All one plus devices are wonderfully built and 6T is no exception. Even though the glass back is there, I didnt find any slippage. Of course I am using the back cover which is already provided with the phone now. But I think it has much better grip than the other phones. 5/5\\n\\nBottom line is that this is a device which you would want to own for a long time. Most of the budget phones start developing problems within 1 year of manufacturing, but that has not been my experience with One plus devices. Even after more than 1 year of using OP 5T, I still got the same performance I was getting during my first month with it. 6T is slightly costly but completely worth it in my opinion.',\n",

I purchased Oneplus 6T 128gb and 6gb RAM version mirror black phone.\\n\\nPros :-\\n\\n1) Super fast processor- can play large games without any glitch.\\n\\n2) Camera is super amazing. However in the night mode, the pictures are sometimes hazy. Overall it is good.\\n\\n3) The phone is damn beautiful. The back of the phone is simply outstanding. Notch also looks cute.\\n\\n4) Fingerprint sensor is working fine.\\n\\n5) Sound quality is good. The speakers are loud and bass is also good. However, the company should have launched it with dual speakers. It would have been phenomenal.\\n\\n6) The company has increased the battery size. It gives a backup of atleast 1.5 days with normal usage.\\n\\nCons:-\\n1) NO HEADPHONE JACK. The company was making fun of Apple for removing the headphone jack, but they did the same. I just have a doubt that how will I charge my phone and watch a movie via earphones at the same time. I have to buy an external adapter which will put a dent on my pocket again.\\n\\n2) If I am holding my phone and have put my thumb impression as my Fingerprint phone unlock option. Then sometimes it is difficult to unlock the phone. Coz while holding the phone I have to put my thumb straight which is quite difficult.\\n\\n3) The night mode of the camera needs improvement.\\n\\n4) No dual speaker.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIt is a nice phone with brilliant specifications. It easily beats some of the high end phones of Apple , Samsung and LG and others. So you may go for it.',\n",

Further one or more price hikes and people will start going back to Flagship companies. Lets hope they keep it as Value for money.\\n\\nRegarding phone:\\nSuperb edge to edge display & battery life - No complaints here. 1080P screen is crisp enough and gives good battery life. Notch is actually just tiny camera and bottom chin has become further thinner.\\nSoftware: Oxygen OS - as usual its clean and gives stock experience with few customizations. Since phone has been just launched have experienced few bugs, but lets hope one plus gives quick updates to solve these.\\nBuild Quality/looks: Thumbs Up! to OnePlus. Glass black and body design does give premium feel. But somehow felt phone is on heavier side (I have switched from OnePlus5 to OnePlus6T and definitely there\\'s noticeable difference in weight).\\nFingerprint scanner: Works well most of the times but not as fast as physical fingerprint scanners we have been used to of earlier phones. If screen gets smudgy you will have problem of unlocking device as it requires clean surface to work.\\nOnly cons, I have experienced in this phone are No headphone jack and LED notification light. Most useful part of LED light was of charging notification. Now you have to wake screen and check. For headphones you do get C-Type connector but as it sounds \"No 3.5mm headphone Jack\" - nothing to describe here.\\n\\nBut overall its a good package and still its a Value for money!

I switched from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and I'm glad I did....Battery life is just outstanding and I've never ever got such a powerful battery ever in my smartphone life. It actually lasts more than a day with lots of playing (I'm a Gamer) and general usage. Camera is also very good and certainly better than my previous phone. UI is clean and lightning fast. Build quality and finish is premium, sturdy and not at all fragile. The in-box Type-C to 3.5mm Adapter solves the absence of headphone jack problem. The supplied case is of premium quality and easily gives all-round protection to any angle falls. Dash charging is superb too. Android Pie out-of-the-box is cool but restricts call recording from third party apps (which is must for me), but OP did a fantastic job of putting in-built call recorder which works flawlessly in Pie as well. As of now, I don't see a single negative point for this phone. Its truly a remarkable one! Thank You OnePlus and Amazon!\",\n",

As expected OnePlus deliver customs expectations.\\nRegarding phone it’s of course best in the market, battery charging takes around 75 minutes from 5% to 100%. Discharging is pretty normal compared to its competitors. Photo clarity is good enough in normal/ portrait mode but night mode I don’t feel good enough, it takes longer time to stabilise and we need to hold and wait. Video and photo clarity is good but not the best in market or less comparatively than my Lumia 950XL. Fingerprint sensor is not much sensitive and takes .5 to 1 sec to open, had a angle problem which resolved in recent update but still lag remains same. Face recognition is perfect. I feel phone is in top 5 for gaming with separate gaming mode, don’t see any lag in WCC 2/ Asphalt/ PUBG. Screen size, display is pretty good and as expected. Sound quality is same as it’s lower end models no much difference. Overall I am happy with other specifics except night mode, fingerprint sensor.',\n",

The OP 6T is a beast of a device. The screen is just beautiful and the gestures so smooth. Using the device is just a satisfying experience. The battery life is also incredible. Easily gets me through two days of average usage. The finger print reader is slightly slower compared to other devices with regular scanners, but its not something to be put off by. The only con I have about the device is the single downward facing speaker. It can easily be covered depending on how you hold the phone so not really a great experience while watching something especially in landscape mode.

       "   'review': \"I was extremely excited about the product and while I prefer ordered through Amazon gift card and bought it on the launch day. I was extremely dissapointed with Amazon. During the sale the offer showed 3/6 month no cost emi and then when I went ahead with 6 months my bank started to charge 13% interest saying we have already given no cost emi discount and now 13% will be applicable. Don't understand the logical behind it, if you are giving a discount why do you find ways to earn it back with false advertisement. Now, the offer has changed and says that's applicable only for 3 months. This really messed up my experience. I have been a one plus user and purchased the same through Amazon on multiple occasion, dissapointed to see the quality and commitment has gone so down so much.\",\n",

Screen quality is great and due to the rain drop notch the real estate has increased drastically.\\n2. Battery life is the best. You charge it once and even after full day use, its around 30 percent. No need to carry a charger now.\\n3. With Android pie the apps run smoothly without a hitch and after a month of purchase, its already been updated thrice.\\n4. Wifi connectivity has increased as compared to earlier models.\\n5. Due to its aspect ratio, the phone is easy to use by one hand.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Camera is good but not too great as the features are basic. One plus needs to work on its camera app and give more features to use double lenses effectively. The video has stability issues.\\n2. The sound quality is better than earleir models but still needs to be louder.\\n3. The screen protector is a smudge magnet and i would suggest a better screen protector.\\n4. The sunlight visibility is not too great.\\n\\nStill after considering all these factors the phone is great and people tend to notice it in your hand.\\n\\nMy verdict:\\nWorth buying. Go for it. You will surely be excited.',\n",

       "   'review': 'I got 8GB * 128GB version. The review it in a word, it\\'s a beast. CNET mentioned it as \"Hero phone without sky high Price\". It\\'s true. At this price range it\\'s a great value for money. OnePlusen launching amazing phone\\'s and this is the latest of the greats. No bloatware at all, nothing pre-installed except few handy OnePlus apps for file transfer and a forum, Definitely enhances the Pure Android OS.\\n\\nGames are running at ultra or high. Haven\\'t hanged at all with lot of apps running, gaming is smooth and this one has a RAM optimiser for the purpose, its my 1st time with SD 845, best fit into this. Good picture clarity too, nearly 2k.\\n\\nCamera is great, especially the portrait mode. Selfies are neat. Though the 2nd lens purpose is limited, reading from most reviews.\\n\\nAmazing UI, appreciation is heartfelt.\\n\\nThe build is brilliant and sleek. Comfortable to put it in pant pockets and can be handled with one hand though I won\\'t necessarily do that 😄. Notch is unobtrusive and looks cool, and hiding option available. Night mode is a good thought. I don\\'t have to download an extra app. (My 1st time with an OnePlus and I\\'m happy about the handy features it comes with, if some features I\\'m mentioning is already there leave it).\\nIn-display FP sensor is faster. I don\\'t have compulsion for it to open in 0.0003 seconds like it has been stressed in the YouTube reviews, it\\'s faster than fast-enough.\\n\\nBattery life is awesome, 3.7k mah. It\\'s like it has a compulsion to stay on. Not at all draining at any point.\\n\\nSound quality is great too, though stereo could have been better. It\\'s like I\\'m hearing everything from right or left side, on landscape mode. Anyways I\\'m either going to use an external speaker or a headset, so no probs.\\n\\nPricing is great, definitely not overpriced. Phone with this specs are being sold at 10k higher prices or of lower quality of experience, by others, and this phone is built with Users in mind, I can confidently say that, it has many handy utilities.\\n\\nOnly problem is something that is not with the phone, actually 2 , a bit overpriced official protective bumper case, and no preferential tempered glass or information about if we need it at all. I got the phone on 2nd November, I still have that out of the box screen cover & case. I couldn\\'t find reliable tempered glass, the Amazon recommended are not fitting the phone screen, and their choice have changed twice in 3 days 😄 . So I\\'ve ordered 3 of them 😁 let\\'s see which will fit, I\\'ll return the other 2.\\n\\nThe protective bumper case is 2k, though it\\'s official it can easily be priced 500rs below (don\\'t say, you can buy the 1.2k priced one right? Both are a bit overpriced. You are great at what you do, you don\\'t have to take pricing decisions like other phonemakers, your flagship is an example for that) And also to OnePlus guys, so many fake reviews in this area. You have to intervene, your product\\'s accessories are being spammed by fake-reviewed Tglass sellers. Better you soon release your own tempered glass.\\n\\nGot the promo code and getting the bullets headphone in a day\\'s time. A small help from a beneficiary. Keep up the good work OnePlus.',\n",

       "   'review': 'I bought 2 phones (one in Nov. 2018 and the 2nd one on Jan. 2019) from Amazon. The new Oneplus Avtar will certainly satisfy those users who can compromise with the loss of headphone jack and notification led. The usb C- headphone jack adapter is in noway an alternative. Similarly, people will expect a stereo speaker on a phone of this price range -- even Poco F1 and Asus Zenfone 5Z provide it at a much lower cost. Yes, 6t offers a lot of excellent features: its superb display, flagship hardware, software, excellent performance, great camera and, to some extent, good battery life, but the loss of some useful feature will deter many potential buyers accustomed with headphones and notification light. Here are some pros and cons of OP6t:\\n\\nPros:\\n1. A flagship with excellent looks and built quality.\\n2. Great optic AMOLED display with superb viewing angle.\\n3. Flagship Snapdragon 845 processor with 6GB RAM (with excellent RAM Management) makes it one of the fastest (if not the fastest) phone available in India.\\n4. Latest android with butter smooth OS\\n5. Great cameras, which become superb after recent updates. Back Camera takes excellent photos some of which are even better than those takes with Google Pixel, iphone and to some extent Samsung Note 9.\\n6. Specific Pixel 3 camera mod has now been made available for OP6t and tested it on my phone. Results are easily comparable.\\n7. Great battery life; for my case with moderate use it lasts more than 2 days. Charging from 0 to 100% takes less than 1.5 hrs.\\n8. Fast face unlocking capability.\\n9. Very good call quality and connectivity.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. No headphone jack and notification LED.\\n2. Fingerprint sensor is slower than that in OP6 although authentication process is accurate.\\n3. Sound quality is good but does not match with the stereo speakers of the cheaper Asus Zenfone 5z or even Poco Fi.\\n4. Only a single base version colour option (mirror black) both front and back sides of which are fingerprint magnets.',\n",

But it's nothing you can't get used to.\\nThe notch is one of the most subtle ones on the market.\\nI would recommend this phone to anyone who's looking for a new Android device.\",\n",

I took it to the service center and they said it's some technical error and they erased all the data... I lost all my contacts and pictures and unfortunately I did not have back up. Wors experience ever. . I did not expect this from a good brand like one place. I'm so unhappy with this. I lost my valuable data. Never had such experience with any of the phone I used till now.... I also read reviews on Google and not only me but many customers have faced this same issue..so so disappointed\",\n",

Mirror black finish also hides the fingerprints to some extent which is also good. Performance and fluid Ness is something which has hooked me for first time for using OnePlus devices.

       "   'review': \"This is my first OnePlus phone and boy am I surprised how good it is. Here are few things I have found after 5 days of usage:\\n\\nPros:\\n1. Great Camera - The camera is awesome in this phone. I have attached few pics taken from this phone and they look great. The color reproduction is not exactly 100 percent but very close. The images turn out a little bit more colorful than they actually are but they look really good. Selfies in portrait mode are very good and even without the portrait mode they look great. The profession mode is wonderful if you can take some time learning how to use it. The pic of the mango that I have posted was taken in the professional mode. The HDR mode produces good evenly lit pictures - the pic of pink flowers against the sky background and the night mode is a great add on. Videos in 4k 60fps are stunning. This in fact is one of the very few phones out there which can record 4k at 60fps which is usually something that most pricey flagship phones are capable of. There is one thing to be noted here though that the video length cannot be more than 5 minutes. I purchased this phone for the camera and it has not disappointed me ever.\\n2. Good Battery life - With some 4 hours of music listening, 1 hour of browsing and youtube videos, the phone drains by around 70% in 14 hours. The charging is fast.\\n3. Speed - The Phone is very responsive and smooth. Haven't played games yet on it but am sure the phone would be able to handle that with ease. It feels like a fast phone.\\n4. Permium feel - The phone is a little heavier than other phones of almost the same size so feels solid and premium. While some people might feel the lighter the phone is the better it is, it's my personal opinion that a slightly heavier phone feels good.\\n5. Screen - The screen is bright and has stunning clarity.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. The in-screen fingerprint sensor - This is kind of the weakest link. The finger print sensor is slow. It feels slower than some of the sub 20000 phones out there. Of course this kind of comparison is like apples and oranges because this is an in-screen sensor and I am comparing it with the sensors at the back but still. It feels slow. The face recognition though is zippy and very fast.\\n2. No provision for 3.55 mm jack. So you cannot listen to songs while charging the phone(Unless you have bluetooth headphones of course)\\n\\nApart from these two things the phone is pretty much complete and at the price at which it is available now, definitely worth the money.\",\n",

After years of tradition of using Moto phones I upgraded here. The OnePlus 6 is a seamless ph with many good things. Within months I upgraded to OnePlus 6t. OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6 t are basically the same phone. It's not much worth upgrading. Both has oxygen 9, same camera, even night mode is available here. Comparatively 6 is lighter and can be held better in hands than 6t. Software no difference. Difference is battery n minimum storage, Tear drop notch. Overall the pH cannot be compared with anyone. It's a giant in itself. Smooth touch, good camera, fast touch responses, everything is very nice. It is difficult cto bring the experience in writing. It should be felt. It's worth to use the phone.\",\n",

I had a few options. LG Q7+, poco, mate 20(not yet released) etc. But after a lot of speculation and hype I went on with the OnePlus 6t.\\n\\nPros:\\n1) Good screen(not the best in the business though)\\n2) Solid Build Quality\\n3) Premium feel and a good looking phone\\n4) Solid battery(1 and a half day of regular use)\\n5) Decent camera.(cannot compare it to the pixels and the iPhones of the world)\\n6) Good value for money.\\n7) Android pie\\n8) Dash charger.(best in the business)\\n\\nCons:\\n1) A little problematic with the Bluetooth connectivity. My old phone S8 had no problems when using a Bluetooth headset. But there is a small issue in this phone. I have to restart the phone again to get it working properly.\\n2) Speaker quality.\\n3) On screen fingerprint scanner.(Accuracy-7/10) and a little slow(hopefully software updates will fix it).',\n",

So she was sick and tired, asked me for a suggestion and we purchased this for her. Right off the bat, the setup process was easier than expected. All her contacts came through immediately, she found the phone big but not so big that she could not handle it. She was initially worried about using such a big phone but now almost 2 months later, she never even talks about her iPhone. She is a person who works daily and has to report her location to her bosses sometimes working late till 1-2AM and this phone works perfect for her. The screen though it is not as gorgeous as a Samsung s9, it has its own advantages. The customisation, battery life, the fact that this comes with a case, the ease of use have all won my sister over and maybe she will never go back to iOS. For this reason, I want to give the phone a perfect 5 stars. I personally use a s9 plus but if I had to go to a different phone, it would be either the Mate 20 Pro or this. Why not? Did I say it is delightful that this ships with inbuilt 128GB? AMAZING.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'What a phone! I have been using it since the past few weeks. Here\\'s my experience:\\n\\nPros:\\n- Battery life for over 16-18 hrs on an average with screen time of 4-5 hrs plus. This is the best I have seen so far, more so impressive with a screen size of 6.4\". So you won\\'t need to charge it during the day mostly. Also, notice a near linear drain until the last juice.\\n- Speed is fantastic. Not seen a single clipping or lag so far. I need to catch on my speed infact ! Games like ashphalt play completely lag free! What more do you want and at this price point ! Hence no need of frequent restarts ! ,😅👍\\n- On screen finger print : Quite unlike many critics, I do not see any issues here. It does take a while to get used to it. Acceptable speed for login/unlock. Its one cool feature to show off,😀\\n- Dual 4G feature on the 6T is a true icing on the top especially for those who use Jio 4G LTE SIM used as a secondary data.\\n- Display is good with standard 1080 resolution, but not the best. There are better out there in the market. More so, with the bundled screen guard, images and videos do not exactly standout like the Samsung\\'s Super AMOLED displays, which I have used before. I my take off the screen guard one day and check out but for now it remains put on the brand new phone!\\n- Camera - Sharp and well above avergae photos with the primary camera. Videos are good but the audio capture is outstanding. Nightscapebis very effective. And then there is the pro(manual mode) which is completely customisable, left to your skill with the lens. I have still to get a handle on that one and hence cannot comment as yet. Secondary camera is also nice. Only, I have some trouble taking selfies with the slim form factor, and get a feel that I am missing out on the larger frame. I may be mistaken here though.\\n\\nCons\\nJust a few :\\n- No \"One hand operation\"\\n- You miss the headphone socket. OnePlus store sells decent headphone (bullet) with USB C plug. You will need one unless you are happy carrying the discerning coverter.\\n- Status icon list is limited to a few. Not sure why? Is it due to teardrop notch? You need to mostly go an additional touch to pull down and view the usual list of icons typically on the status bar. I find it slightly inconvenient and irritating.\\nNothing more to crib about!\\n\\nOverall a great phone from OnePlus!',\n",

Premium feel\\n2. Camera the best\\n3. Speed, it is really fast enough\\n4. User friendly OS and latest Android\\n5. Battery and dash charging (15mins tips from 0 to 75% of battery)\\n6. In display finger print is fast once you get used with right angle and spot. Trust me it is fast\\n7. Annoying notification light is gone. As an alternative one tap on screen gives all notification\\n\\n*Cons*\\n1. 3.5mm jack missing, may be we'll get used to it\\n2. The dongle provided for 3.5mm jack is very thin, the wire is easily tend to break. Could have been thicker like the charger wire\\n3. YouTube and play store often doesn't work with WiFi whereas via mobile data it works flawlessly. Hope an update will rectify this issue\\n\\n** Amazon put some quality time on package department**\",\n",

Though the slow motion is cool but its of zero use at night.\\nBuilt quality....extremely good and feels premium to hold.\\nI went fir tge mirror back edition,though what they say is true,it is a smudge magnet.but still tuck it in a tpu clearcase and it it looks awesome.\\nSound quality...its one of the best i used till date..its so loud that that my room mates have grown to hate it :D\\ncoming to the display...well it okay sort...my previous op3t had a better display than this...*on comparing op6,op6t and op3t hands on..i'd op3t was the best followed by op6 and then op6t! The coloyrs are much vibrant on the previous two even when kept on same settings(default screen calibration).\\nIt takes exact 1hr and 27 mins to charge from 0 to 100...same as op6...despite having a bigger battery.\\nUmmm what else....\\nYeah...the finger print sensor...i know its slow as comoared to the traditional finger print sensor...but God its so cool..the difference is notocable for people coming from one plus line.\\nBut the lag of 0.20s is acceptable...with the contant ota ipdates the fingerprint sensor has seem to gather up speed and seems to open much faster..\\nIts open 8 out of 10 times i try..but with face unlock on..you wont even notice the delay of 0.20s...\\nBut belive me...it is fast...damn fast as comoared to the other phones out in the market...tested it against vivo v11 pro.. verdict: op6t blows it out of the park.\\nOxygen Os...has gone to a whole different level with gestures 2.0. add 8gb of ram and a snapdragon 845...you just glide from one app to the other...buttery smooth...they werent lying when they cam up with the advertisement for op6t!!!\\n\\nCons:\\nThe nightscape mode is more of like a hit and miss thing...at lowest it will give you an image with 0 enhancement...but whennit does it job,it produces fairly good images..but at the cost of sharpness.\\nHeadphone jack....well i miss it..i often hate the fact that i need to unplug the charger to listen to music or watch a video at the end of the day.\\nThe weight is noticable...my op3t was about 155gms...op6t is now 185gms...so i constantly realise when i pick up the phone...dang this is heavy!!!\\nIt is a tad bit narrower than op6 about 0.5mm and with the screen size being so large..its seems like a long glowing rod at night!\\nAlso since the screens are rounded at the corners there is loss in pixel and video content...you will notice it much clearly while playing pubg...afterall the game has more buttons than a nascar car!\\n\\nIf you have any questions,do ask!\",\n",

       "   'review': 'So I’ve had the OnePlus 6T for a good month now and I think it’s time for a review of the device.\\n\\nSome background – I wouldn’t call myself a fanboy but I’ve owned all OP phones except for the 3 series. I find their performance to budget ration incredible and while they’ve had problems till OP2 with mediocre hardware, OP5 was the best android experience I’ve had in quite a bit. Then they followed up with the 6 which stuttered a bit out of the box, but they’ve managed to iron out the kinks and now is definitely close to the Pixel when it comes to usability. No hyperbole.\\n\\nAnyway, coming to this phone, it is definitely one of the best android phones out in the market at this time. The 6 was a good step forward, but I wanted to wait for the 6T and so got this instead. Pretty much everyone here has talked about the specs and the water drop front camera, so I’ll talk about quality of life with this device for over the period.\\n\\nThe exterior has never been exposed to the elements owing to the silicone cover that came bundled with the phone. It is a gorgeous looking device with typical OP design hints. People have always asked me what OP device it is – meaning OP has already established itself as one of the better looking manufacturers of mobile phones.\\n\\nThe camera is fantastic. I have attached a few images but you can’t make out the difference when the resolutions is scaled down. If I’m being brutally honest, I’d say this is still a few notches below the big players, Pixel and iPhone X. But it’s good enough to blow almost any other phone out of the water.\\n\\nOne Plus is a fantastic brand and I urge you to give it a shot – for me, it has been one of the best Android experiences ever.',\n",

Oxygen OS 9.0... And many more updates to come..\\n> Fast charging.... wow.. and its not fast.. its super fast... 30-40 mins charging enough for one complete day batter life for a decent user...\\n> User friendly options like Read Mode, Night Mode and specially Gestures .. Which i use the most :P\\n> Camera ... Many reviews says it is not upto the mark... Dude this is a phone and not a DSLR... for a Phone i would rate it 10/10 no doubt on that.\\n> Build Quality... If you dont have any case cover.. i would say it has a very classy and shiny look... If you are a person who wants to show off the their classy phones... go for it... Apple has lost its trend.. now its OnePlus time... in India :)\\n> I have never used a rear fingerprint sensor... so i am super fine with this on screen fingerprint.. Even when it works perfectly fine for 9/10 times..\\n> With a button press we can move from Ringing<->Vibration<->Silent... Thank god i dont need to unlock phone always... :D\\n\\nCons:\\n> I have couple of good Earphones and Headphones... and now i cannot connect them to this... Why... Because this beast dosent have a 3.5mm Jack :/\\n> Phone is little big to keep in Jeans... A pickpocketttteerrr can easily take it out .. Need to be little careful there.. o_O\\n> Now that we wanted to show this phones classy side.... and if we dont put a case... it is very slippery...\\n> Only one speaker at the bottom.. I am ok with it.. who plays a video/song now a days on a speaker...\\n\\nWill add more to this... after few more weeks... until then... \"Never Settle\"',\n",

For a normal user it will last easily for about 1.5 days on a single full charge.\\n\\n2. Display is sharp, crisp and colourful. Not as good as my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 but still it won't disappoint. Way better than my One Plus 3T. I can say it's the best Full HD+ display on any phone right now. And that water droplet NOTCH. I love it.\\n\\n3. Build quality is purely a flagship level. Phone feels ultra premium. It looks as beautiful as my Note 8. The phone sandwiched between gorilla glass 6 just blows me away. It's really beautiful.\\n\\n4. Performance wise it's somewhat similar to one plus six as they both share a common processor. Nevertheless, no complaint, thumbs up. As they say, Speed and yeah it really is speed. Super snappy and powerful. No issues playing PUBG, game run super smooth.\\n\\n5. Though it's a single firing speaker, but it's definitely loud and clear. Way better than my Note 8 and 3T.\\n\\n6. Sound quality of calls is crisp, clear.\\n\\n7. Camera, is fine for me. There is no comparison with Note 8 as it clearly tears it apart but still, 8/10 for the camera for sure. Does every thing that I can expect from a camera and it out performed Note 8 in some areas as well. But still, thumbs up, as I said, it does all the work. So no issues whatsoever.\\n\\nP.S. : I really miss the headphone jack. RIP to the good old one plus devices that featured a headphone jack. :)\",\n",

Just my 2 cents:\\nPros:\\nIncredible Battery life with the fastest charging system on the market.\\nScreen is vibrant and has various colour modes to suit your preference.\\nPerforms like a champ with gaming loads such as Pubg and Asphalt.\\nSlim and light though mandatorily needs a case as most of the construction is glass .\\nCamera is a hit and miss sometimes, highly recommend the Pixel 3 camera app port. When it works well, the pictures are fantastic.\\n\\nCons:\\nSome minor bugs such as the accelerometer requires a shake sometimes to get orientation.\\nThe bokeh mode is a hit and miss with recognizing faces and objects.\\nBuild quality is top notch (Heh!) but fragile.\\nIf you're used to a 3.5mm jack, you will most certainly miss the jack.\\nNever cared about wireless charging so that didn't really matter to me.\\nMono speaker.\\n\\nIt may have a list of niggles but it will most definitely make you smile when you use it and still at the end of the day have 40% battery left.\",\n",

The face unlock is so fast that by the time you place ur finger on the fingerprint, it would have unlocked the phone.\\nAll other features are fine and amazing.\\nPlease don\\'t compare it with the flagships from Samsung or Apple.

       "   'review': 'One of the best investments I have made so far.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the Pros first:-\\n1) Build Quality:- For 38k the built quality is amazing. You get that premium feel as soon as you hold the phone in your hands.\\n2) Screen Quality:- The screen quality is good. Better than the IPS LCD displays used on Asus Zenfone 5z. Colours are very punchy and the display is very crisp.\\n3) Battery Life:- This is the biggest pro of this device. The 3700mah battery lasts easily for one and a half to 2 days on heavy usage. It can easily last for 3 days on medium usage. The best part is that we have the amazing OnePlus Dash charger. It takes 1hr 28mins to charge from 0 to 100%.\\n4) Oxygen OS:- The Best thing about OnePlus is their fast and fluid UI. It\\'s very close to stock Android which makes the device very snappy. You do not notice any lagg whatsoever.\\n5) In-display Fingerprint:-The USP of OnePlus 6T. Trust me the the fingerprint is very very fast. You can\\'t compare it with that Vivo device which first came with this technology.\\n\\nNow the Cons:-\\n1)No headphone jack:- Not a deal breaker but it might be annoying for people who use wired headphones.\\n2)No Stereo speakers:- The sound output from the speaker is loud enough but considering the price of this device they should have provided stereo speakers.\\n3)No LED Notification Light:- I don\\'t understand why they removed it. You have to rely on the ambient display always.\\n4) Not so good RAM Management:- I think this is a software bug. I have noticed this several times. Apps like YouTube & Instagram does not stay in memory and reloads. This is quite annoying. Hope they fix this with a software update.\\n5) No Wireless Charging:- They call it \"Flagship killer\" but there\\'s no wireless charging.\\n6)No IP Protection:- It\\'s the 8th \"FLAGSHIP KILLER\" device from OnePlus but still no IP rating.\\n\\nFinal Verdict:-\\nIf you already have OnePlus 6 or even the 5T, there\\'s no point of upgrading to 6T. Instead you can wait for next 6 months and get your hands on the OnePlus 7. The OnePlus 7 will come with Snapdragon 855 which will have support for 5G. Also we will see improvements in the camera and it might even come with Stereo speakers and an IP rating.\\nBut if you are currently on an old laggy phone with poor UI, battery life, and looking for a premium device but don\\'t want to spend more than 40k, the OnePlus 6T will prove as a very good upgrade.',\n",

Pathatic on screen finger scanner. Slow, most of the time not responsive. Just a glittery feature of OnePlus 6T with very poor/slow response.\\n2. Battery life is good but not as good as the picture painted around your head by the Company or OnePlus phones users but yeah! Dash charging is one of the highlight of the phone.\\n3.Service centres and customer support of OnePlus is so pathetic that they just don't care about your concern and always gives you automated replies even without understanding your concern.\\nAt one point you'll feel frustrated with all of this and the backhand customer care team/online support is the real issue for the prospective buyers of the phone or existing users.\\nI hope that no one will face that situation.\\n4. Please do not compare this device with iPhone X or later because apart from dash charging, price, you won't appreciate anything of oneplus 6T.\\nDon't choose OnePlus 6T over iPhone if budget is not the issue.\",\n",

Works like a charm. everyone talks positive content, let me point out few negatives i experienced in this (Not applicable to everyone i guess)....\\n\\n1)The in-display finger print display sometimes takes more time than it has to. so it can be said that a dedicated Finger Print sensor is better than this. Not that in display finger Print sensor is bad, but sometimes not very responsive. and i hate when at night time when i try to unlock and a WHITE BRIGHT SCREEN comes upon to detect my face for face-Unlock (Which can be disabled).\\n\\n2) The Camera quality is not that great AS EXPECTED, but its really good, but i expected a little more clarity.\\n\\nThese two are the only Negative points i see. Rest of it, its a wonderful mobile and i'm having a lot of fun using it. i'd say BUY IT, coz there's no way you can get all the features available in this mobile for such a low price while in these days a mobile with high specs comes for a minimum of Rs 60,000. GO FOR IT.\\n\\nNOTE TO ONEPLUS :- Bro, take some time and come up with better looking and thinner bumper cases. Come on dude, we spending for you.

Looking so premium, perform amazingly fast literary no logo can be seen any of the normal apps its loads in a blink of eye when the finger tip once touches the icon. Camera is very appreciable but not upto the performance of highend flagships like pixel or IPhone Xs, but it does a very reasonable job for the money we are paying. Many reviews can be seen that the speakers are not stereo and its bad, i don't think so, its loud and clear. The Android PIE customised OxygenOS is good and neat which gives a feel like stock android while its perfectly customised for so many good features that lacks in many of the stock android smartphones but it should also be noted that Oxygen is not perfect by all means i reported some bugs in the alert slider, downloading huge apps from playstore, headphone ringtone volume issue but hopefully they are giving timely updates hence clearing bugs out of it. Battery is decent, for a device having SD845 and 6 gigs RAM and large Amoled Display a full day is big enough but I am a really heavy user playing PUBG for hours, streaming youtube, browsing, FB, whatsapp, downloads and full time 4G data ON and also have dual sim setup so i need to hit the charger twice a day but the charger is amazingly fast, i just go for a bath or having a snack and back boooyah.. battery charged to more than 75% its enough till i sleep. And finally the Amoled Display, it's not upto the displays of Samsung's Note series or Galaxy series but trust me its really nice, the tear drop notch and very thin chin and bezels gives makes the display more appealing, i put a decent beach wallpaper from Wallpapers Craft and sometimes i can't take my eyes from the display its so satisfying for the eye's. Indisplay Fingerprint scanner works fast with a nice animation, and the lack of headphone jack and wireless charging i don't care about it.\",\n",

The image quality is same as on the honor 10 in some cases honor 10 images were better. Video picture quality i felt was better on H10 but the overall stabilisation is much better on Oneplus 6t. Where it beats the h10 is the selfie camera. Battery life slightly less than H10 due to screen size. Screen quality is only slightly better than H10. If this helps.',\n",

       "   'review': \"After using 15 days these are my observations.\\n\\nSpeed wise it is very good as it have 8GB Ram with Snapdragon processor. Look wise its very nice and design and quality of the material is good. When come to Fingerprint the animations are looking fabulous while unlocking but some times not capturing for 2 or 3 sec then giving no detected message. Need improvement there. Coming to camera need more improvements overall. The one option I am regret is clicking picture only by using the capture button. As my moto g2 have full screen capture option and g4 have fingerprint to click option with screen. But here we don't have any fingerprint option also so sometimes while taking selfies for large group its very difficult to capture using the only button. Same time by using earphones also we are not able to capture images. Need software improvement there.\\n\\nComing to calls while taking with earphones we are unable to mute the call by using earphones. Which is there for my all previous phones which are very low budget ones. While taking client calls it is making very uncomfortable because I am used to earphone play/pause button to mute the call.\\n\\nComing to network while in call the internet or messages option is not working. Internet usage my be restricted while in call but the messages option need to be improved. Because in some urgent call if some one calls we need message them back saying so.\\n\\nOverall its good to use but need some really cool improvements software wise.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Over the past couple of years, every phone that OnePlus has made has indeed been incrementally better than the previous one it makes. That can be traced back from the time the OnePlus 3T succeeded the OnePlus 3—which was already a very good phone at the time. This unflinching consistency has paid dividends here too. The OnePlus 6 was already a great phone to own, and the subtle changes make the OnePlus 6T even better in many respects—the foremost being the new Android on board, and the improved camera. The thing is, if you have already invested in a OnePlus 6, you really don’t need to rush to buy the 6T. But for anyone else looking for a genuine upgrade over their existing phone, this is ticking off all the boxes.',\n",

The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.\\n\\nThe display is a 6.41-inch AMOLED panel having 19.6:9 aspect ratio. Thanks to its 85.6% screen to body ratio, the phone doesn’t feel large in hand despite the big screen size.\\n\\nThere’s no upgrade in the display resolution this time as well. It has a full HD (2340 x 1080p) display with 402ppi pixel density. But in all honesty, the AMOLED display on the OnePlus 6T still offers gorgeous picture quality. The colors pop, it looks immersive and there’s no compromise with the details.\\nThe back of the phone is relatively cleaner, as there is only the camera setup since the fingerprint is moved under the display. On the right edge of the phone is a power on button, which is one of your options for waking the device – the other is a double tap on the screen - and above that is the signature OnePlus slider that allows you to mute your phone with a quick flick.\\nOnePlus has done splendid enhancements in their smartphone design over the years. But of all the designs, the OnePlus 6 looked like their most premium work till date and that’s a constant on the OnePlus 6T. The company uses a 3D glass back on the phone which looks great without compromising with the essentials.\\n\\nGOOD\\nGreat battery life\\nFluid performance\\nTop-end design\\nImpressive rear camera\\nBAD\\nNo headphone jack\\n'Only' full HD resolution\\nNo microSD card slot\",\n",

Awesome picture quality with loads of camera options to go for, bokeh mode, night mode, potrait mode and pro cam option.\\nSound is decent and as expected from any flagship killer phone, quality which u even get in iPhone which you buy for 1lac or 80k. So why not put 40 and get yourself best.\\nBATTERY LIFE is the section you would appreciate the most I start my day with 99% and ends up with 60% remaining, yeah I know people have there own way of using phone and I totally agree with that as when I play PUBG previously I had to charge my phone after 3 full games which I can play at least 8 games in full now. Whoe let's not forget the best part of charging. With the dash charger it charges 0 to 100 in merely 1hour and 15 mins.\\n\\nYes many would miss 3.5mm Jack for headphones but oneplus fixes that by providing c type converter to 3.5mm in box so no need to worry and my suggestion is Bluetooth headset which is trend at the moment.\\n\\nSo afterall I am really satisfied with the phone I will complete 30days of usage tomorrow.

Now talking about this phone(u all know the specifications) :-\\nPros:\\n1) Display (specially the notch)\\n2) Battery capacity\\n3) Processor & Ram\\n4) Camera\\n5) Software (smoothest of all)\\nCons:\\n1) Slightly Slower In Display Fingerprint\\n2) Lacking 3.5mm Jack(which means u can't use headphones while charging)\\nI won't mind charging before playing games. But they have to increase the speed of fingerprint scanning(though this is the fastest) ..\",\n",

No doubt can't compare with samsu g note 9's dsiplay but still price point comparison justified.\\nSound Output- nothing much special. Good quality not excellent as LG G6\\n\\nPerformance- superb. Nothing can beat this. Everything seems so smooth.\\n\\nOS- I like oxygen os. No blotware and no nonsense application. Just giving you what you want. Very good customization options and rich in terms of settings.\\n\\nCamera- I didn't get any opportunities to capture in different condition but whatever I have used I liked all photos and videos.\\n\\nBattery : stunning battery backup. I usually get 6.5 hours of screen on time. If you don't play games and moderate use, 1.5+ days of battery backup.\\n\\nSome things you will miss in OP6T.\\n1) headphone jack for sure bcz I was using previously headphone jack mobile and now I don't have headphone jack so I really miss that.\\n\\n2) Type c bullet headset is not good enough. Not worth of 1500 INR.\\n\\n3) after gaming of 1.5+ hours, phone gets little warm and I can feel that even if I use case. But no drops in fps of games so that didn't bother me.\",\n",

The screen is better, the phone is faster (not sure if it is faster than iPhones I mean their Bionic chips are really fast), and the battery is good plus it has dash charging which has its side effects to the battery.

Till date the best One Plus has to be the 5T and except for a few gimmicks (for e.g. the on display finger print scanner) there isn't much that goes for this phone. So why did I buy this one. Very simple, I did not want to miss the UI on the phone as it is the closest you get to a stock Android feel w/o having to bust your bank to buy the Google Pixel and the base variant this time comes with 128 GB storage which was helpful since I had almost used up all the storage (of 64 GB) on my 5T.

       "   'review': \"Amazon Oneplus lucky star is a new way to scam people, luring them to buy Oneplus 6T. When I called the customer care before buying the phone, he said 600 individuals are getting 600 prizes. After purchasling the phone, the customer care is saying 1 person is getting all 600 prizes which doesn't make sense. What would one person do with 600 gifts which is a obvious scam by Amazon. The customer care of Amazon gives wrong information to the customers luring them to buy the product. Really a cheap trick by Amazon Oneplus lucky star! I ended up buying this product! Please don't fall for such offers! Be aware people!\",\n",

       "   'review': \"apologies for the seemingly 'clickbait' title of this review. i'll be as concise as i can.\\ntl;dr: great battery life, a well tuned camera. go for it (this isn't a paid/fake review lol)!\\n\\nCAMERA: has a really high dynamic range. i have been doing street photography since two years now, all based out of a phone camera, as opposed to a dslr or something. although previously i have used budget devices (occasionally a flagship phone belonging to someone else), i have learned a lot. since my genre involves capturing a quick moment, a good/smart hdr process really comes handy. this phone retains details in the HIGHLIGHTS much, much better than a galaxy s9/note 9, iphone x, comparable to pixel 2xl. nope, no exxageration. zoom performance is okay, as it's digital. the secondary lens seems gimmicky, with the company claiming it to help with depth sensing. on covering the second lens, a message does pop up (in the portrait mode). i feel like they can utilize it better with different algorithms. i see wasted potential. the hardware is the same as op6. NIGHT SIGHT from the ported gcam app is INSANE. the stock app is also great at processing photos in LOWLIGHT. if you're like me, if you feel like capturing something in the middle of the night because it looks magical, this camera will not let you down.\\nVIDEO: if you have tried any sort of filmmaking, you'll understand the importance of shooting in 60fps over 30. NOTE- ois is used for 1080/4k 60fps. eis is used for 1080/4k 30fps. eis is amazing during the day, but falls short at night. 4k 60 means you don't get as much light information at night, but it'll have better stabilization. i wish there was some way to manually change that. the final output, once you realize these certain points and use it to your advantage, then it's amazing! TRUST ME.\\nSELFIE: video called to 1080p with eis, has a great dynamic range. but, i feel like the gcam mode performs better while taking selfies, especially selfie portraits.\\nCAMERA final thoughts: if you know what you're doing, GO BUY THIS PHONE.\\nif camera isn't as important to you, then please read on. 4 times out of 5 you'll be happy with what you capture.\\n\\n*just realized i said i'll be concise hahahah* *i'll try again*\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: the first few days of extreme heavy usage set me back a bit disappointed, as i got a bit more than 6 hours of sot. DON'T MISUNDERSTAND- it's good. definitely. but it didn't quite match up to what i saw online. so get this, i'm not the only one who felt that way.\\nBUT WAIT! after using this phone for 3 weeks (give or take) battery life has improved. i have provided a screenshot for the initial usage, which shows a little over 6 hours. YESTERDAY, i got nearly TEN HOURS.\\nif you're an average user, but still feel like you use the phone heavily because of a few gaming sessions, you won't be disappointed. i don't play games much, but my camera usage is extreme. that explained why i felt disappointed.\\nBATTERY FINAL THOUGHTS? most of you out there can use this phone easily for an entire day. if you're a casual user, then you'll be VERY happy with the battery backup.\\n\\nCHARGING: dash/rapid/warp charge- as fast as ever. 10/10. doesn't throttle the performance. neither does the charging slow down with simultaneous use.\\n\\nSCREEN: I LOVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT CALIBRATED MODES! oneplus does it right. it's quite accurate. i use dci-p3. for most default is best, as the colors have a lot of saturation, with inky blacks. GOOD brightness, not great though with direct sunlight. BUT WAIT! a paid app (search high brightness mode) enables the actual potential. NOT KIDDING. basically, oneplus has restricted the maximum brightness you can get, to ensure longevity (FOR A GOOD REASON). use that app at your own risk, as toggling it on for long periods of time may be harmful for the phone, as that's not what was intended originally. please don't blame me if you use it without researching further. however, if you are smart about it, you'll be REALLY HAPPY with the results. HONESTLY!\\n\\nDESIGN/BUILD QUALITY: this is something HIGHLY subjective. beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. personally, i'm in love with the minimalism and symmetry. despite the beautiful glossy finish of mirror black, i feel like midnight black/thunder purple showcases how much oneplus cares about ERGONOMICS. i am usually horribly careless with my phones. and this has a glass back, way less durable, seemingly. YET, i feel safe while holding this. they have oaid attention to subtle things, like the amount of curve at the edges of the backside, to make it easier to grip. the matte texture feels so close to a metallic surface, im not lying. if anyone you know has a 6 or a 6t with a matte surface, please do check it out. NOTE: please make sure you have a case on, as glass is glass.\\ni have dropped this phone 4-5 times (which made my heart skip a beat every time). one of the corners has a slight dent (which still makes me feel really sad). however, the materials used are really good. op6 had gorilla glass 5, this has gorilla glass 6. don't be fooled though, glass always has a high chance of breaking. oneplus phones last a long while. they don't have any water/dust resistance certification, but the phone won't be damaged if it comes in contact with water. please don't push it though.\\n\\nFINGERPRINT SCANNER: *evil laugh* if you're still reading, i cannot thank you enough. i hope i was able to help you understand the experience a bit better. okay, i shouldn't stall amy more. the fingerprint scanner isn't as fast, or as secure, or as adept as a regular capacitive scanner (read: oneplus phones before 6t).\\nDON'T MISUNDERSTAND THOUGH. if you don't compare, oneplus makes the experience seem really smooth. yes, the accuracy suffers a bit. BUT, the novelty of this feature, i feel, makes up for it. it makes me smile every time i use it.\\nTHAT'S NOT THE ENTIRE STORY THOUGH! oneplus claims it becomes faster with time. at first, in my first week, i felt like this was a smart way of creating a placebo effect. the words felt like a plain marketing talk. BUT, THEY WEREN'T WRONG. i understand the arguments against the scanner, mainly, a) it forces you to look at the screen everytime you want to unlock, in which case the face unlock despite being less secure, would be faster, b) the positioning could be better & c) the feedback doesn't induce confidence if you actually unlocked or not. true, true and true. BUT, as skeptic as i was, i promise you, it has gotten better and faster. how do i attest that? well, earlier success rate was 75%. it did feel like a let down. it seemed half baked. change for the sake of change. NOW, IT'S UP TO 95%. initially it made me feel angry at oneplus, as it felt like 'IS THIS IT FINALLY? has oneplus SETTLED?' *there you go, the headline of my review* jokes aside, the angles that would fail before, wouldn't fail anymore. i do have a guess at how they're achieving this, but i don't feel like boring you any more than i already have. i tried my best to be as honest and unbiased as i could have. let that strengthen your confidence in my verdict about the scanner. trust me. it gets better with time. this is due to artificial intelligence and i'm glad that they didn't loosely throw around the term (*cough* LG/HUAWEI/OPPO *cough*). the way artificial intelligence works, i can ASSURE you that it should get better with time. it has, for me.\\nNOTE: screen protectors do change the experience. oneplus recommends you to re-register the prints. this is definitely a huge annoyance, as it could lead to wastage of money just to figure out what works. i suggest go with reviews, ones which have a more number of reviews, especially 3-4 stars and not 5. if you see a 5 star rating, it probably was the brand itself.\\n\\ni apologize for this long read. if you still are reading, then i think i can assume that you long for this phone. else you wouldn't have read this far. i understand. just, go for it. it's worth it as long as you don't have an op6. wait for 7 if you really want an improved experience. actually, the way they work, and if it means that much to you, wait for op7t. it'll be worth the wait. moreover the op6 will last you well over two years.\\n\\nsigning off,\\nalimpan pal (op6t 8+256gb)\\nps: i dropped out of college to pursue filmmaking. would mean a lot if you visited my instagram page. currently working on my own domain. till then please check out my work, it's all based on phones, you'll definitely find it unique. look up _theunbreakablevow_ (with the underscores).\",\n",

The phone feels fast and responsive and oxygen os is pretty good in my opinion. The camera is decent although I would have loved a different secondary lens like a wide angle one. Battery lasts me a full day easily and still has 30% charge remaining by the end. There are a few minor compromises but they dont matter to me personally so I have nothing to complain but i'll still list them out. They say its water resistant but it has no IP certification so I don't know exactly how water resistant it is. No headphone jack but I already used bluetooth headphones even when my phone had a headphone jack so not missing it at all. No wireless charging but I dont use that either so doesn't matter to me.

Bang for bucks.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'I have recently bought OnePlus6T and have been using the phone from past few days. Here is my feedback on the phone:\\n\\nPros:\\ni. Android Pie is smooth in its functionality. The upgrades are definitely adding further improvement to the UI.\\nii. Camera is the best you can find in any phone. Low light photography is amazing. Front portrait pics are clean and decent. The quality of the photos are incredible and unbeatable with any other phone of the same price range.\\niii. Battery backup is unbelievable. One time full charge is approximately carrying for 9 hours which includes heavy gaming like PUBG.\\niv. Snapdragon processor is very fast. Under heavy graphics HD mode, PUBG is smooth in its gameplay with hardly any lag.\\nv. Dual sim VOLTE support is yet another added advantage with smart wifi switching option.\\nvi. Sound is very high and crystal clear. The speaker is very powerful and mic is also very sensitive.\\n\\nCons:\\ni. The edges of the phone which are having place for menu, back button are little difficult to access with the case cover (Minimal problem but can be adjusted with)\\nii. Slight lag in the indisplay finger print sensor (taking little longer than expected) yet fast enough not to lag your work.\\niii. Ambient display brightness is sometimes unable to adjust in sunlight which may be stressful to the eyes\\n\\nOverall verdict is that the phone is a true definition for a flagship killer.\\n\\nNOTE: I was using Oneplus 3 earlier and my pros and cons are based on the comparision of my previous experiences',\n",

       "   'review': \"Il try to give a detailed and honest (personal) review of the handset so that people looking to continue with the legacy of OP6T can make a choice. OP6T has not changed much in terms of RAM/ROM/SoC config, as it remains the same as OP6. My device config is 6GB/128GB with Snapdragon 835. The camera config also remains the same so you'd be getting the same pictures with OP6T as you were getting with OP6; apart from a minor s/w update which includes the Nightscape camera. Description as to what it does can be found online, but personally, I don't think it is making much improvement to the pictures that are captured in low light during the night. Another significant change is the display, as it contains the waterdrop notch instead of the boat-shaped notch, and also has a higher screen to body ratio as compared to the OP6. The result is a bigger screen and a viewing experience that is much better and less distracting than the OP6. The loss is that the company had to strip the LED notifications to make the notch smaller. I was not really that addicted to LED notifications, so it did not really make any difference to me. So if summed up, the display is something in which Id like to give the company some credit points for making a beautiful AMOLED display in 38K. Moving further, the major change which highlighted the device all during the launch - the inscreen fingerprint scanner. It is quite intuitive and an interesting concept, but I would say that it is still a territory for flagship manufacturers that need to be researched and improvised before it is made public. Again, as I said it is very intuitive and you'd be kind of amazed by the tech put behind it, but it kind of fails the fact that fingerprints are supposed to be an easy and fast way to unlock the device. Face ID is surely taking the smartphone industry by storm, but on any fine day, I'd use my fingerprint to unlock my device rather than the face. But OP6T has made me realize that Face ID is much easy to use and unlock the phone. And the reason is the slow fingerprint scanner. I could actually feel the time it takes to unlock the phone. And no, it doesn't take a second to unlock. On paper it is 0.34s, but I kind of felt the 0.34s being taken by my phone to unlock. It fails a little more than a couple of times a day when it doesn't recognize my finger/thumb, but Im guessing it might get fixed with some future software updates. Moreover, the Face ID comes to the rescue everytime the fingerprint scanner lets me down. The tech is new and interesting and still needs to be worked upon before it is launched in a flagship. The last major change is the loss of 3.5mm headphone jack. Now, this was something which OP could have dodged, but then how would have they given a better and bigger battery. The battery is 3700 mAh, which is bigger which means that even though you get more juice to run your phone, it takes probably longer for the dash charger to charge it. So coming back to the headphone jack, it is not there. Again, it does not really matter, as you get a single type C port, both for charging and plugging in a headset. You get a type C to USB adapter, and to be honest the 3.5mm jack would not create much stir as people are quickly moving towards wireless tech. Unless you have a high spec wired headset, then you may give it a thought.\\n\\nAll in all, One Plus delivers with the new 6t. It has some highs and lows, but then its kind of giving you everything for 38K. Not many makers would offer you that. Its my first One Plus device, and I am pretty satisfied with it.\",\n",

That's not the case in reality.it does show lockscreen for almost a second.

       "   'review': \"Early days into using the phone, but have loved every bit of the experience till now. First and foremost it is surprisingly easy to use, I mean it adjust very easily into the grip even after it's relatively big size. The curved back makes it easy to use and manoeuvre . The camera is pretty good and does well in all of it's mode but yes still some distance away from the quality of Pixel cameras. The battery life is great and last for almost 24-30 hours per charge. The oxygen OS is almost stock like and gives a very uncluttered experience. The performance of the phone has been top notch - switching between apps is smooth, performance during games, watching youtube videos etc has been fluent and top notch. The in-display fingerprint works almost perfectly. It's fast but at times is unable to recognize. That is probably the only complaint with the device. Good Job One Plus. :)\",\n",

The software has some problem as the screen text becomes big suddenly. One Plus must look into it as the reputation of One Plus 6T may go down if others also face similar problem.\\n\\nI still think One Plus 3 was performing extremely well than One Plus 6T. I sometimes get a feeling that has One Plus secretly named 'T' as Temporary or Beta Version before the launch of next version say in this case after 6T Launch of 7. Its just a wild guess as had faced Zero issues with One Plus 03 for almost two years since purchase. 6T was purchased brand new from Amazon but its software does not perform well\",\n",

The front camera of the phone is also really good which is of 16 megapixels. The phone supports slow motion videos at two levels i.e, 240 fps at 1080p resolution and 480 fps at 720p resolution.\\nSaying about the build quality, it is really good. I had a time of bad luck when I met with a bus accident as the bus(sleeper) toppled and I kept my phone on the seat, the phone was thrown around inside the bus and to my luck nothing happens to my phone although I had an official OnePlus 6t phone case on it.\\nBattery life is really good on this device. It will easily last for a day on heavy usage or even a day and a half with moderate usage. Charging speed is really good. Before I go to college I charge it during the time I get ready and that is enough for the phone till evening.\\nComing to software oxygen os is really good and snappy although there is some features missing from the stock android operating system although they have better features added to it\\nSaying about heating of the device, I should say it never literally overheats, the only time I found it overheat was when I was using CamScanner for a bit long. Gaming was completely fine as it never overheats during gaming although it gets slightly warm near the camera region which is least bothersome.',\n",

Again the fingerprint sensor at night time when all lights are off and when you unlock ur phone with fingerprint sensor the screen brighten ups to it's fullest (like it's stealing my eyesight 😜)\\n3.

My friends who have iPhone X, take pictures in my OnePlus 6T.\\n\\nSound Quality : The only negative thing in OnePlus 6T. When you play a game or watch a video, you tend to cover the speaker which is at the bottom. Very badly engineered. You block the sound when you play games or watch videos\\n\\nBattery life : Above average. I wouldn't say it's good. When I turn off Bluetooth, location and others, except Data, it lasts more than a day for me.\",\n",

I donno about the previous OnePlus models, I just entered the OnePlus community with the 8 GB +128 GB Version\\nAs far as the mobile goes it's a beast, I'm totally satisfied with the performance of the product\\n\\nPros\\n1. Awesome Processor - Snapdragon 845 at its best, combined with the 8 GB RAM, you experience 0 lag on a perfect WiFi connection\\n2. Good Daylight Camera, 4K video with 60 fps frame rate felt dang awesome\\n3. Big Cheers for the near complete Display, OPTIC AMOLED gives a great viewing experience\\n4. Speakers are loud but having Stereo speakers would have done great to this mobile\\n5. DASH Charge works great! Speed is what you need\\n6. The USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone jack cable is sturdy, I was worried that the earphones piece may fall off but nodes within the jack space save the drop and hold it in place\\n7. Good Delivery and the Packaging, fell in love with OnePlus\\n8. InDisplay Fingerprint scanner is awesome. It takes less than half a second to do the job\\n9. Face unlock is super fast\\n10. Near Stock Android UI is great..! Oxygen OS simply does a terrific job\\n11. Teardrop notch is awesome, although I covered the notch area for my notification bar and the blacked out notification bar is great\\n12. Adding a USB C Hub expands it's functionality, combining with the 6.4 inch screen almost gives a PC like experience\\n\\nCons\\n1. Battery life doesn't seem that great although I'm a kinda heavy user\\n2. Night camera is bad, My RX 100 mk2 does a great job when compared to this\\n3. Camera zoom is terrible, I hate that part of the Smartphone camera. Again My RX 100 mk 2 does a great job\\n4. Implementation of the fingerprint on the power button would have been good, take a note OnePlus\\n5. Adding a display that supports 4K would have been a great thing, of miss 4K videos on YouTube\\n6. Next time release Gaming phones with add-ons like 120 fps display, 4k display and a gaming chip\\n\\nOverall it's a beast\\nI gave my honest opinion\",\n",

While using Instagram camera to click a video or story the quality or picture and sound it poor.\\n\\nIt has numerous pop up ads on any thin you use. So be aware of it. With the latest software update there are issues while using apps like Unfold where the keypad doesnt close for you to be able to use it's options to edit.

Thanks to night mode.\\nbokeh/portrait mode is exceptionnaly better than s9 and same with Day light.\\n\\nDisplay - S9 has better display but u cant use that otherwise your battery wont even last for 3 hours. Oneplus 6T has Amoled display which is enough for me.\\nIndisplay Fingerprint - Using first time in any mobile, i liked it . response time is few micro seconds more than traditional finger print scanner. only few ms.\\n\\nFace Recognition - Great, even in full dark. most of the time u wont even see the lock screen as soon as u press the lock button it opens. In full dark, it uses screen light to recognize the face.\\n\\nProcesser and performance - Best in class. i used to play pubg in high settings without any heating issue. All games runs very smooth. i tried GTA, asphalt, need for speed NL, etc.\\n\\nGesture support is great after update. Its very fast and user friendly.\\n\\nSound - Single speaker, Speaker sound is OK, not so great. S9 has better speaker sound than this.',\n",

But now i do not carry my 6T charger at all even if it s for 2 days.',\n",

       "   'review': \"I had always been opposed to One Plus products, mainly because they were of Chinese origin, and I had a fixed notion that Chinese products were prone to cut corners, and therefore not always up to the mark. I have been using iPhones for the past several years, and was quite happy with them. It was only recently when iPhone came out with their flagship phone range 10 that I realized that they had, in their greed, priced themselves out of my affordability range. I mean, who wants to pay one lakh rupees of one's hard-earned money for a phone?\\n\\nSo, since I had already purchased FOUR One Plus phones for people who were not net-savvy, and had received good feedback from them, I decided to buy one for myself. I was absolutely bowled over with the phone once I started using it because it had everything that my last iPhone had, plus a lot more. The speed was far, far superior, as were the cameras (and quality of the photographs) and the battery life - I can easily go for two days without recharging my phone battery.\\n\\nTo summarize, I would recommend this phone to anyone without reservations - you will get more than fair value for your money.\",\n",

Now after a month this phone has gone mad and started flashing on its own, the battery is draining on its own, the phones gets heated like crazy, the phone's fingerprint sensor is not working, the phone screen has gone berserk and the lighting is too high. I have tried returning it but this stupid amazon policy states that we cannot return after 14 days which is cheating..... Simple Words i will never again shop on Amazon ever in my life for any electronic products. Although, the service centre has asked me to bring the phone for checking the firmware. i am disappointed with Amazon sales, as i never expected this month phone to go become unusable within 30 days of purchasing.

Its night mode feature is killer and quality is so good.\\n- Battery : I could use phone for more then 2 day with normal usage when charged full.\\n- Dash charging - oh, this amazing really fast.\\n- Notch - Really impressive, one don't even realise if its there.\\n- Memory : Ample of space, got 113 GB of space, which is actually more then my mac book pro :D\\n- Ram : 6 GB ram is more than enough for me as i normally don't play heavy games nor keep many activity window open.\\n- Processor : Good, can give better review after usage for more than 2-3 months. as of now no lag.\\n- Face unlock - This is killer, you won't even realise when the unlock happened, very fast.\\n- Screen quality - Dense pixel make screen very good with large view. Good auto brightness and colours.\\n- In display finger print scanner - This looks fancy, very rarely i had to use it because of good face unlock. Although i felt its bit slow compare to normal finger scanner.\\n\\nCons:\\n- No 3.5 mm jack. Although you have connector its not very convenient. Alternatively i had to invest in bluetooth headphone.\\n- Screen size, For not many of you it will be a cons, but for me i feel size is little bigger to carry in hand. personal choice, Anyways it gives bigger view when use full screen camera.\\n- No notification led, I felt they did not kept it because of smaller notch but i really miss that as every time i have to actually check the phone if someone has messaged or call me as my phone is mostly on silent mode.\",\n",

I can play PUBG without any issue. Also 6 GB is so far seems more than enough for me.\\n2. Battery Life - Battery life is a very important factor for a heavy user like me. With a heavy usage it goes for a day. If I use moderately it goes upto 45 hours. Though the battery optimization is the part of Android 9.0 but thanks to Oxygen OS, unlike Samsung it doesn\\'t drain battery when idle.\\n3. Fingerprint Under Display - it\\'s been said \"in screen fingerprint\". But the correct term should be \"under display fingerprint\". Anyway its not as fast as regular fingerprint reader but its good for every day use and most importantly - it\\'s super cool 😎\\n4. Built Quality - comparable to premium flagships like Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or iPhone XS\\n5. Oxygen OS - Oxygen OS may not be pure stock Android but I believe this is how Android pie should have been. I believe Oxygen OS completes Android.\\n6. Global LTE bands - Since it has almost all global LTE Bands so this phone is highly recommend for International travellers.\\n7. Camera - As I am a DSLR guy so I am always biased against phone cameras. But I must say tgis phones picture quality is 7/10. Would have given 8 if nightmode would have been better. May be OnePlus will fix it with a patch upgrade.\\n\\nGreat Job OnePlus. My best regards -',\n",

After a recent OS upgrade my died and started rebooting endlessly. It was time for an upgrade. I like the premium phones I used and hated Android for not being fast and smooth. But this premium brand has just overpriced their lineup by crossing 1L pricing mark there's no point in spending that much for just a phone. After a lot of reviews and considerations I've opted for OnePlus 6T and it was under my 40k budget.\\nWHAT A PRODUCT!! Brilliant phone with all bells and whistles that you get on a premium brand and it is surprising to have come from a company which is just a few years old. I'm very happy with this phone and with OnePlus brand itself. I'm not going away from this brand anytime soon and will be upgrading on this platform for many years to come.. Bye bye fruit!!\",\n",

Here are some pros and cons-\\nPros-\\n1) Water Drop Notch\\n2) Screen Unlock\\n3) Bigger Battery\\n4) Amazing Camera on both sides\\n\\nCons-\\n1) If you wanna unlock your phone via either Screen Lock or Face Unlock, you have to make screen on,which is annoying sometimes. In this way I like my OP5 because there is FPS and I can unlock my phone just by pressing it. I am sure One Plus will look into this.\\n2) Nightscape- Although I am very used to Oxygen OS but I cannot fully satisfied with Nightscape mode of camera. It always gives blurry pics but happy with overall performance.\\n3) No LED Notification- Due to waterdrop notch they sacrifies Notification light, which is very disappointed from my perspective. well I think that if there is no hardware for LED notification then OP team should come with a software update by which a small pixel work just like a notification led.\\n\\nSo here are some pros and cons. Considering these cons I still give 5/5. It's just amazing phone. And if you compere with any other smartphone for eg Pixel 3,then it is far way ahead of those.\\n\\nA must buy for premium phone lovers, I can bet you'll not get disappoint by this.\",\n",

Face recognision is the other best alternative which works rapid fast unless its totally dark. Battery back up is descent till now, full charge in almost an hour. with all videos games and downloads it might drain out by the end of the day. which means daily 1 hr charge, hopefully the batter performace last for couple of years.

       "   'review': \"I am guy who is 22 yrs old but till date I have used 18 phones.. This is my 19th phone.. previous I have been using apple for the last 3.8yrs... But unfortunately on last sunday I lost my phone on highway.. After that I was very confused which phone to buy Android or ios.. Because as we all knew that touch sensitivity of apple is always top notch n people who are using iPhone will always opt for apple.. But this time I had a different experience with One plus 6t.. It's not an amazing,good looking ohine but it can perform as well beyond limits.. It really very fast with only 6GB RAM I sure hope it will perform much better with 8GB RAM.. Build quality is top notch, design is satisfying enough for a stand alone in the crowd.. Camera n display is way better within this price tag.. And lastly but not the least you get all the features n this premium phone at only 38k for 6GB Ram n 42k for 8 GB Ram with dual sim and 128 gb internal storage... So where do apple stand infront of this phone when compared with price tag.. So please go ahead n buy this phone without any hesitation or doubt..\\nThank you\",\n",

The phone lives up to the hype. Its a true geeks companion. The huge number of settings available might overwhelm someone who is only using phones to click selfies and tiktok videos. Picture quality is undeniably good. Sound quality is amazing. Battery life extends upto 24 hours. Dash charging FTW. Power management is great. Stock OS is the best. No longer there's a NEED to flash some custom ROM unless you WANT to. In the end it all boils down to how you treat your phone. Be it any phone. Treat the device well. And let the device show you what true performance is. Money well spent.\",\n",

Android Auto Issues: App crashes multiple times on launch. After multiple times when it is launched the still gives you money issues like a) cannot hear incoming call volume everything goes mute ,when music suddenly stops you need to look at your phone to see the incoming call, before oneplus 6t the notification itself used to come on screen and the incoming call volume used to come out from car speakers. b) USB cable keeps on disconnecting randomly you have to connect it again and again multiple times for it to work. c) it stops recognising voice commands randomly.\\nAlthough the voice command to control navigation works perfectly fine.\\n2.Bluetooth connectivity with MIband3: most of the time the bluetooth connection gets disconnected automatically. when you try to connect it manually it does not work you have to forget the device and then pair it as the new device.\\n3.Google contacts: i use google contacts to maintain my contacts. During the transfer to this phone my random contacts went missing. Okay I made peace with it. Then randomly some contacts were erased from my google account which were there after migration. I restored the contacts to 20 days back. But again the contacts started disappearing. Still unable to figure it out. Also my offline playlist on google play music was deleted.\\n4. Camera Issue: In normal mode Upper half of my photos are mostly blurred especially the ones containing text. I have set everything to default again and tried multiple things but nothing works.\\n\\nSome of the issues maybe related to Android or Google but I have never faced such issues before with my other devices.',\n",

Front camera is biggest improvement over OP3\\n5. In screen fingerprint sensor is just a little slower than normal fingerprint sensor on OP3.\\n6. Missing headphone jack, only thing which disappointed me till now. USB C to 3.5mm cable is included in the box.\\n7. Back cover provided inside box is best fit, no need to buy any cover separately also screengaurd is pre applied.\\n8. Guaranteed exchange program is promising must go for that.\\n\\nBought this with exchange and with HDFC card offer making effective price of 32650/-. Thanks to Amazon for that.\\n\\nOnePlus is by far the best optimised Android phones in the market with minimal, stock like customizations.\\n\\nGo for it if you haven't used OnePlus ever before you will definitely love this device and if you are already using OnePlus device then you would know the user experience is the best when it comes to Oxygen OS.\",\n",

And it's it wayyy better than iphone cameras c:\\nYou can shoot videos upto 4k 60fps and it is very smooth and sharp.\\nFront facing camera works well too ( get Google cam Port for the best portrait selfies, you're welcome)\\n\\n-Build quality is very good, best looking and feeling Android phone under 40k.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- No headphone jack. RIP jack.\\nbut as long as you get the usb c bullets, you won't miss it at all, and you don't have to worry about using ur earphones while charging because you will hardly spend time charging this phone. Charge it when you wake up and get ready for the day and have a cup of coffee and it will be charged\\n\\n-No wireless charging, but hey dash charge 🤷🏻\\u200d♂️\\n\\n-No major upgrades from the OnePlus 6, if you own a OP6, don't get this phone. Wait for a 7 or 7t\\n\\n-No ip rating, but can survive a few dunks in the water\\n\\nSo if you're okay with USB c audio and want a great looking phone which turns heads, but also perfoms like a Beast, you should absolutely get this phone, best Android phone you can get right now!\",\n",

The Google Play Store app update or download takes hours while it takes just seconds on my other phone, Mi Max 2. I use Airtel 4G SIMs on both phones. One Plus 6T has another Jio SIM. As far as other internet activities like browsing are concerned, I have not noticed any difference from my experience with my earlier phone, Samsung Galaxy A9 Pro. Then comes the shocker this morning. I called One Plus India helpline 1800 102 8411. I was asked to choose my language: press 1 for English and 2 for Hindi. I pressed 1 for English. I was told that was an invalid option 🤔. Pressed 2. That was also an invalid option. \\U0001f928 When I repeated it for the third time, I was hung up on. I called up again. The same thing kept happening!!! I tried to post in the One Plus Community, where again I was told I could not post!!! Now, what do I do? Do I smell a huge scam?',\n",

The only con about the one plus 6t that i would like to mention is, the in display finger print sensor which works well but a times fails to unlock if the finger is not perfectly placed, but this issue being a very minor one, the pros very well surpasses the only con. Talking about the camera, it has one of the very best lens under this price category as compared to other handsets. The portrait and the night mode is commendable along with the selfie cam.

       "   'review': \"I've upgraded from OnePlus 3 to OnePlus 6t and it's an huge upgrade for me firstly I will start with design which is perfect it's jus feels really good the OnePlus has designed this phone and it's crazy fast everything on the phone is so smooth and responsive thanks to oxygen os and display is gorgeous I cant stop looking at it again and again , performance is class leading due to snapdragon 845 and software optimization and battery backup is great on this phone for normal users it will give two days backup with around 4 hours of screen usage and normal calling and for heavy using it will easily last a day , there's only one thing I'm bit disappointed is charging which is little slower than OnePlus 3 which takes around 1:15 to charge and OnePlus 6t takes around 1:35 to charge i don't know why even though it's fastest among the competition 😎 , so the bottom line is if you want spend 40-60k on a phone don't think about any other phone just go for it\",\n",

       "   'review': \"This is a performance phone. I've been using this set for nearly 2 weeks and I haven't faced any lags or heating issues even when I open multiple tabs or games simultaneously.\\n\\nI noticed a lot of op6t users are facing lags in in-display fingerprint scanner I think it should be said that it only works perfectly if you place your finger right on the spot where the greenish light shows up during unlocking and even if this doesn't help what you can do is add two or three finger imprints of the same finger.Its taking some time to unlock, maybe because it's one of the first generation phone that has in-display fingerprint sensor (after a considerable improvements over the other phones that has been previous released). If it makes you feel any better then the scanner actually becomes faster with its usage believe it or not it actually happened in my case .\\nComing to camera , OnePlus competes with every other flagship phones in almost all aspects but I believe certain camera improvements are yet to come.The nightscape mode actually surprised me when i tried to take a picture at about midnight but the picture becomes a bit blurry when one tries to zoom in and take a photo though this can be overcomed by using a telephoto lens but then our budget would be compromised.Another issue, new users might be facing is the flickering of videos when you're recording in slow motion under fluorescent lights, thats because if the frame rate exceeds 120 fps then it will capture frames faster than fluorescent lights so if you capture in artificial lights you will see flickering.\\n\\nThe charging is explosively fast, it charges from 0 to 80% in about 30 to 35 minutes.the button vibrate mode and silent mode really comes in handy.Lastly considering the price range what I am getting is pretty great. There's a reason why OnePlus is overthrowing Apple sales in India.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Waited 2 months for this beauty cum beast to launch and here I\\'m reviewing the same from the beast itself. Along with the OnePlus 6t, I had kept Poco F1 and Asus ZenFone 5Z as my other options but finally decided to go with the OnePlus 6t. Let\\'s go through it\\'s features point wise...\\n1- Availability\\nAs a customer, waiting for something u want to buy badly is the worst thing. I made up my mind to buy this device after watching almost all the reviews on YouTube of OnePlus 6 , Poco F1 and Asus ZenFone 5Z but black colour was not my first choice. It was only available in black variant at the time of launch with no information about any other variant. This is why I could not avail offers during Diwali time. I had to wait 15 more days for the \"Thunder Purple\" variant to launch but that too was launched in flash sale fashion which is something not expected from OnePlus. Though later they made the thunder purple variant available all the time.\\nDue to this marketing style, OnePlus ends up forcing some customers to choose the variant which may not be their first choice and as a customer u feel dissatisfied.\\n\\n2-First Look and Build Quality\\nIt was like love at first sight. I could not get my eyes off this beauty. The purple colour merging with the black colour on the top looks mesmerising. Build quality, as heard in several reviews, is top notch. And talking of notch, the water drop notch adds up to the beauty to look even more stunning. Full marks in this section.\\n\\n3- Performance\\nHeard it, Seen it, Used it and Felt it. Undoubtedly it\\'s the beast when it comes to performance. You\\'ll feel the smoothness as u use the device. I have used my friend\\'s Poco and Asus ZenFone 5z too...but the experience is smoother in this device for sure. Full marks and OnePlus for the awesome Oxygen OS in performance section\\n\\n4- Sound Quality\\nDecent enough but lacks the experience of a stereo speakers. What to do...Dil Maangey More h(Never Satisfied)\\n\\n5- Battery Life\\nEarlier I was using a mobile with 4200mah battery which was giving more than a day backup easily. I was ready for a decrease in the backup with OnePlus 6t as compared to my earlier device but the experience was just shocking. OnePlus 6t was giving the same backup as a 4200mah phone. Adding to this amazing battery life is the dash charger which charges the phone with such a great speed that you\\'ll doubt who is in more hurry...You or your charger!!!\\n\\n6-Picture Quality\\nIn normal lighting conditions it undoubtedly takes awesome pictures. Saturation level is just perfect...Colours captured are always close to the original apart from some rare moments when I felt that pics were on warmer side but that\\'s just me!!!\\nNight mode pictures are better than Poco and Asus ZenFone 5z but surely you don\\'t want it to be compared with Google pixel\\'s night mode!!!\\n\\n7- Gaming\\nI have 8gb variant and I must say that my gaming experience till now is amazing. With the specs and software provided in this device, u don\\'t need to even think about your gaming experience... it\\'s bound to be buttery smooth!!!',\n",

The hardware setup which they are using is top tier but the only place where the camera falls short is the poor algorithm for Night Mode. Rest assured, XDA devs will probably push a Gcam later this month which will most probably pull the camera department upto a Solid 9 if not 10. Will update once that happens !\\n\\nBATTERY:\\nThis phone has the best battery backup I've seen in the industry.

But, yeah, this new tech is evolving, so it's better to give it some time to show its full worth. And if you're placing the finger the way you should on that in-display sensor, then its performance is right on the money.\\n\\nPlus, the absence of the headphone jack is discomforting, but that was a necessary trade-off if you want to enjoy that futuristic in-screen fingerprint tech.\\n\\nNow that we've dealt with the performance part, let's see how this device performs in the LOOKS department.\\n\\nAs far as this device's looks go, it's gorgeous.

The OnePlus box packing is awesome. I even liked it before opening. Coming to the phone, it has all the best features with best working quality one can expect. The Face unlock is super fast, like it's gets unlocked even before you realize. Finger print scanner is very good and it got better after Oxygen OS 9.05 update! The gaming is awesome, I played PUBG and it's very smooth and cool on this phone. The sound quality and picture quality are as expected. Need to mention the Nightscape mode especially, it gives a great picture as if it's very clear even in the pitch dark!! Oh God! The battery! The battery life is the coolest thing in here! I only charge once in a day to 100% and that's all. With continuous use of the social apps like FB, WhatsApp and Instagram and gaming for 3-4 hours the battery isn't under 15% after 13-14 hours 😍😍 Even though I hated the large screen phones(one of the reasons I bought iPhone SE) this one looks different though! With the screen resolution and different modes and themes the phone is just beautiful! It's a lot better option when compared to highend flagship phones which are over priced!\",\n",

That's largely because of the optimization of Oxygen OS done by OnePlus. It's like Android on Steroids. Blazzingly fast and smooth. The best of all, awesome battery life.\\n\\nI consider myself to be a very modest user of smartphone. I don't play any games and my only uses comes from taking calls, occasional social media and web browsing. My phone always has LTE on, and screen brightness set to 70%. And amazingly I have had battery lasting me for more than 2 days at times. Attached screenshot is just taken, and you can see for yourself. I have had last full charge 2 days ago, with 2hrs of total screen on-time till now. And it still shows my battery will last for another 1day 22hrs based on my current usage pattern, with 48% battery left. That too with Battery Saver mode not activated. I have set Battery Saver mode to activate when battery reaches 15%.\\n\\nAnd if you need to recharge, the Dash Charger can full charge 6T in just under an hour. That's just Awesome. I would recommend this phone to anyone who needs a phone that just lasts longer, much longer than Note 9 without a hefty price tag but with a battery that's just shy 300mah at 3700mah instead of 4000mah offered in Note 9.\",\n",

Apart from 6, If you own any other smartphone, Its a bang for a buck and a truly amazing experience awaits if you switch. Well, I've upgraded from a 4-year-old Nexus 5 to 6t and boy am I impressed?\\n\\nBuild & Design\\nI was amazed by the truly bezel-less design and an amazing 6.4-inch screen. Fantastic design and build quality. Youtube videos are stunning at HD and if you are a gamer, this is the screen is for you! The notch. It's the best the technology could get close to acheive a bezel-less display. Trust me, It adds to the design and it's not odd at all.\\n\\nSoftware\\nBetter than stock! Say's the one who's been using stock for 4 years in a Nexus 5. Oxygen just fly. The speed you need!\\n\\nIn-display Fingerprint Sensor\\nIt's true that the sensor learns your pattern over time. It got super fast over a period of time. I've turned off face unlock. The fingerprint sensor is just way too convenient as it's right where your thumb already is while you operate your phone.\\n\\nCamera\\nI've attached a few sample images. Those are untouched and raw images. The primary camera is probably the best in the market (excluding Pixel). The images are crystal clear. Well, balanced colors. Portraits are great. DSLR quality images right out of our pocket. But pretty disappointed with the nightscape feature. It doesn't do what it's supposed to do. Other than that, The camera is simply awesome!\\n\\nBattery\\nI get 26 hours with an average day to day usage on weekdays. Since I use it a bit more heavily on weekends, I get about 22 - 24 hours with a continuous screen time of 6-7 hours. Over and above the dash charger does the rest of the magic. 10 - 100% in just 1 hour.\\n\\nSpeakers\\nThe bottom firing speakers are great for indoor music. But Oneplus could have look at the stereo option for the 6T. A little disappointment there.\\n\\nOverall the 6T is worth every penny you spend. You are getting the best of everything at a reasonable price. The 6T will keep you on trend and updated at least for the next 2 years. Just go for it :)\",\n",

Great camera. At per with pixel 2 from my own experience.\\n5. Not so great button to change the phone mode from ring to vibrate.\\n6. Great battery life. Yesterday I started my day with 86% battery at 10 am, now its 7:50 am and its 13%. I am an avid user.\\n7. I have played PUBG on this with extreme graphics settings. It runs smoothly.\",\n",

This is the only phone where notch can be hid in every single App I have used so far (LG G7 phones notch only hides the lock screen and system pages and not third party apps)\\n2. Brilliant camera. The night mode shots are perfect and way superior than any camera. Even better than most DSLR. However recommended to use trypods to geteven better results.\\n3. Software. Simply can say better than stock Android. Lot of shortcuts, guesturs and customizable options. Buttery smooth and lag free.\\n4. Dash charging. Super fast and power bank has become redudant in my case.\\nCons.\\n1. No head phones jack. (Why One plus?) I already lost the headphone dongle.\\n2. In display finger print scanner is not that accurate in detection. 30% I find myself redoing it. At the same time it's slow.\\n3. Feels bulky compared to one plus 3\\n\\nI used this phone for 3 weeks now and worked well with international roaming in China & UAE with no call drops and high speed data.\\nCompletely recomed this phone ..\",\n",

       "   'review': \"I ordered OnePlus 6T on the day of launch. Amazon delivered in a day. Wonderful, as usual.\\n\\nThe phone is blazing fast and it's positives are well documented across review websites and blogs. I am covering just my 1 day of initial experience with the phone.\\n\\nUNBOXING - The package has a phone, charger, a 3.5 mm jack to Type C converter, a silicon case. The phone has a screen protector already fixed hence doesn't need another.\\n\\nType C converter is very useful for those using wired earphones. I use OneMore triple driver and this converter is handy.\\n\\nBUILT - I have upgraded from Oneplus 3. There was nothing wrong with my previous phone just that couldn't resist upgrading. My OP3 feels slightly sleeker than this one. I must say I like the metal back of OP3 as compared to this. The rest of it is pretty good.\\n\\nSCREEN - OP6T is clearly well ahead on this count. The resolution is better and so is the color quality. The difference can clearly be felt on pictures.\\n\\nDATA Transfer - there is an OP switch app on playstore. Use that and it works like a charm. 36GB moved in 37 minutes with zero loss. Contacts, SMS, logs, media, apps, accounts, etc. For other phones upgrades too there are apps available.\\n\\nNO 3.5 mm jack - I am a fan of my wired ear phones (I invested in OneMore triple driver which cost 9k) Convertor is a useful tool but the main issue is you can either charge the phone or use the earphones but not both at the same time.\\n\\nNo NOTIFICATION LED - I miss the fact that I could just glance from far to my phone and know that it needs to be seen. Here I have to lift and open it.\\n\\nIN SCREEN FINGERPRINT - Saves some screen estate for sure and makes the screen feel larger. However it's not as fast and efficient as the hardware finger print. Also, hardware finger print works the moment u place the finger on it even when phone is asleep. Here u move the phone, it activates the screen and then u finger scan. Small advise - activate 'double tap to wake' and 'face unlock' and 'ok Google' so that u have multiple options to unlock the phone.\\n\\nAll in all, I still find the phone well worth to posses specially for the camera. I am a happy user.\",\n",

After using indisplay fingerprint scanner, you'll forget about rear mounted ones.\\n\\nNotch : This looks extremely good compared to oneplus 6\\n\\nCamera : Both Cameras nowhere close to my S9+. But easily beats a number of other smartphones.\\n\\nStorage : you get around 115gb free\\n\\nRam: 6gb is more than enough. 4000 inr for extra 2gb is not worth it.\\n\\nFace Unlock : Probably The Fastest Out There.\\n\\nGaming : Games load faster than ever.A lot Faster Than S9+\\n\\nDisplay : Display is crisp and clear with FHD+ resolution. But since i have been using S9+ also so i can clearly see difference between QHD and FHD display. Brightness is less compared to S9+. HDR 4K videos are supported in 6T\\n\\nCharging : 1 hour 15 minutes for full charge ( Can Vary Depending On How and When You Plug In)\\n\\nOS : Android 9 With November Security Patch\\n\\nSpeakers : Same As 5T,6. Nothing New Here\\n\\nAudio Jack : Gone. Using Dongle Is Not Everyone's Cup Of Tea. But Those Prebooked Will Get Type C Earphones. So no worries here.\\n\\nHeavier Than 5T,6 due to increased battery size.\\n\\nHope you find this useful for your purchase\\n\\nNote : Don't Compare This To Trash Phones Like Poco , Zenfone etc.\",\n",

Graphics:Both phone are euqal no one looses here. Battery: Without a single doubt in my mind I can say V11 is the winner here.(on a 100%charge on both phones we started playing PUBG on high graphics and full volume my 1+ was switched off after 6 round of games but V11 had 20% of juice left in it) and finally Price: I really really regret buying 6t instead of V11pro which has all the similar feature for almost half of the prize. I would recommend Vivo v11 pro any time to anyone.\",\n",

And luckily, I have chosen an awesome product! OnePlus 6T is soooo smooth to use! The specs are unbelievable. The battery is big and easily lasts more than a day. But for me the camera is the biggest surprise. It is so much better than my expectations, especially the night mode. Yes, the phone speaker could have been much better as compared to Nexus/Pixel phones. But the Bullets Earphones totally make up for it. And since I got them for free as a pre-book offer, they sound even sweeter 😋. All in all, keep up the good work OnePlus. Glad to join your family.',\n",

I also find the phone back cover that they provide quite good. It's an amazing phone experience, you can go for it.\",\n",

The pocket mode turned on by itself and it is very annoying.\\n\\nTo those out there considering to press on that update button for your 6T, DON'T DO IT! It ruins your experience.

The battery lasts for a complete day with average usage. The sound quality is also great. Only revolutionary aspect is it's In-Display finger print sensor and works flawlessly fast.\",\n",

Many gestures don't work on lock screen which are supposed to work on lock screen. Many other issues are there,when I wanted to return , voila😀 there is no  return policy for this on Amazon. what they do is only replacement of same phn,same model, same colour, everything same ...ifff there is any physical damage.
